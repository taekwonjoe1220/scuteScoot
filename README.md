# scuteScoot
Scute Swarm is a card in Magic The Gathering (MTG) that makes copies of itself and takes some keeping track of. I decided to collaborate with a friend of mine (all the original design work was done by him) to make this to help keep track of how many copies were on the board.

Everything is done in vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS. 

This is currently only setup to view vertically on mobile. I might go back and fix it for horizontal viewing later, but for now enjoy it in vertical mode only :)

Feel free to critique and give feedback here in github or anywhere else you find this.
